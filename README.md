# Documenting-API

A simple project that uses HTML and CSS to build a documentation for an API called Room API (A university coursework). Postman was used to discover endpoints and their required parameters, request body, request format and repsonse code. This project also uses OpenAPI to design an extension for the Room API.  View the documentation at my (GitHub Page)[https://maxong99.github.io/Documenting-API/].
